Places where the user should enter input will be marked by '>'

Engineer menu can be accessed by inputting 5 on the main menu, and typing in the password of 'password'.

I decided that the user would insert coins like so: 1 for £1, 2 for £2, rather than 100 for £1 and 200 for £2. 
I did this because part of the task was to think about how a real vending machine would work, and a user would not
insert 100 or 200 pennies into a vending machine.

I also chose to distinguish items by them ItemID as it provides a definite unique identifier for each stock item
and I think it makes most sense to purchase items based on their ID.
